CommunitySim simulates an ecological community, such as a microbiome
using Lotka-Volterra based models. In particular, dynamics of species
are simulated assuming a third species can influence the intensity of
pairwise interactions, an assumption referred to as a higher-order
interaction.

## Introduction

Lotka-Volterra describes the change of abundance of species relating to
the abundance of all members in the community:

where alpha\_i is species i’s growth rate without the influence from
other species; b\_ij is the impact of other species on the growth of i,
on a per unit basis.

The higher-order interaction states that a third species can not only
interact with other species in a pairwise manner, but also influence the
intensity of existing pairwise interactions in the community, which is
modeled by b\_ij:

Here the pairwise interaction intensity is modeled as a flat rate
modified by the abundance of third species, x\_k.

With varying interaction intensity and initial abundance of species, the
change in abundance of the community over time can be studied by solving
the coupled ODEs. This package provides a simulation of above stated
parameters, and a solver for the coupled ODEs.
